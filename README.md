> An interview puzzle to create a simple HTTP log monitoring program.

A simple program that mimics alerting and monitoring behavior of the ELK stack,
done for an interview. This program will monitor a given [HTTP access log][CLF]
file and provide alerting and monitoring.

## Challenge Requirements

* [x] Consume an actively written-to w3c-formatted HTTP access log. It should
  default to reading `/var/log/access.log` and be overridable.
* [x] Display stats every 10s about the traffic during those 10s: the sections
  of the web site with the most hits, as well as interesting summary statistics
  on the traffic as a whole. A section is defined as being what's before the
  second `/` in the path. For example, the section for
  `http://my.site.com/pages/create` is `http://my.site.com/pages`.
* [x] Make sure a user can keep the app running and monitor the log file
  continuously
* [x] Whenever total traffic for the past 2 minutes exceeds a certain number on
  average, add a message saying that:
  `High traffic generated an alert - hits = {value}, triggered at {time}`.
  The default threshold should be 10 requests per second and should be
  overridable.
* [x] Whenever the total traffic drops again below that value on average for the
  past 2 minutes, print or displays another message detailing when the alert
  recovered.
* [x] Write a test for the alerting logic.
* [x] Explain how youâ€™d improve on this application design.
* [x] If you have access to a linux docker environment, we'd love to be able to
  docker build and run your project! If you don't though, don't sweat it.

## General Improvement Plan

This code is meant to reimplement some standard functionality that I would
generally not implement myself:

* [ ] Total traffic alerting implements its own "cleanup" concept, where as the
  top section monitor implements a simple in-memory time series database. I
  would probably use ElasticSearch for both of these, as there's really no
  reason to try and write a custom time series database without a use case or
  performance issue that isn't accounted for by one of the many existing
  options.
* [ ] Monitors and Alerts aren't interfaced. Although I kept with a common
  pattern, I didn't account for some `Add` functions needing errorability, and
  given my attempt to timebox this, I didn't want to iterate on it forever.
  There's some room for improvement there though.
* [ ] Creating new monitors and alerts shouldn't require code. Perhaps a DSL of
  some sort, or just relying on Kibana/Grafana rather than implementing this.
  ELK is pretty powerful without needing to reinvent the wheel.
* [ ] Test coverage of Monitors is non-existant, but I believe they work. Would
  like to add more coverage here.
* [ ] Go's default testing is pretty limited. Perhaps using a TDD or BDD
  framework would make these much more useful. `testify/assert` or
  `smartystreets/convey` would be my gotos.
